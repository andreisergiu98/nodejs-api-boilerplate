# Nodejs API boilerplate

## Description
None, yet.

## Development setup
First things first make sure you have the following programs installed:
- nodejs
- yarn
- docker
- docker-compose

I highly recommend using an IDE: vscode, intellij, webstorm.

To start your development environment run the following commands:

```yarn
# install dependencies
$ yarn

# start the docker containers
$ yarn start

# test
$ yarn test
```
